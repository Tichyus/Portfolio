# Portfolio 

Here is the start of my portfolio. Audrey Mezin helped me with the design and I did the coding part.
As you can see and I'm sorry for it, the site isn't complete at all. 
I did not manage my time well enough and spent to much time resolving bugs with animations to be able to deliver it in time and finished. 
I have a version with routes made with php/slim/twig but I did not manage to make it work with my host. 
We assume the responsability of course but still hope you will appreciate this preview. 

## Made with 

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JS ES6

### Technologies

* lots of css animation with JS
